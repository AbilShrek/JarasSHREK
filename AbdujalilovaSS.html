Luffy, commonly known as "Straw Hat Luffy" or simply "Straw Hat", is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates.[26][27] He pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to become the new Pirate King[28] and reach a further, untold dream (currently known to only his crew, family and closest friends).He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.</p>
